MovieExplorer

This project was realized using D3 (https://d3js.org/). For the sliders the additional library nouislider (https://refreshless.com/nouislider/) was used. The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

This application is a web application. It targets only modern browsers, so please do not use a "browser" like Internet Explorer. It is tested with the newest Google Chrome and the newest Firefox and probably won't run in other browsers as it uses the new Ecmascript 6 standard.

There are some layout problems on smaller screens, so this is ideally used on a FullHD screen or at least not much below that resolution, or else there could be not enough space to display everything. Workaround for smaller screens:  Zoom out (Ctrl -). Unfortunately it is necessary to reload the page after the browser window size changed.

The application can be started by opening the files in this folder (index.html) or by simply visiting https://pakwan.github.io/MovieExplorer/
Note that this is an Open Source project (https://github.com/pakwan/MovieExplorer)

Have fun!
